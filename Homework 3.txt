A) 1: 8(%ebp) contains str2
   2: 12(%ebp) contains s1 integer a
   3: 16(%ebp) contains pointer p

B) In the first slot, we move y pointer in %edx. The third slot moves x into %eax. Second slot holds location of initialized strl. 4th one holds s1. 5th one also holds s1

C) The values are stored next to each in the registers but their memory space is given to %esp.

D) This function returns the individual values in order of the stack pointer


3.67)

A) 
e1.p: 0
e1.y: 4
e2.x: 0
e2.next: 4

B) 8 bytes

C)
void proc (union ele *up)
{
	up-> e2.next->e1.p = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up -> e1/p;
}
