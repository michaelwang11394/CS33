I began by downloading the .tgz file from CCLE onto my local disk. I then scp'd
the file over to the Linux server and untarred it by running
- scp openmplab.tgz classgiu@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:/u/eng/class/classgiu/
Downloads/
- tar -xvf openmplab.tgz

I first compiled the executable normally by running 
- make seq
- ./seq
and this yielded an output of

FUNC TIME : 0.469581
TOTAL TIME : 2.358748
I then profiled the program by compiling with gprof enabled
- make seq GPROF=1
- ./seq
- gprof seq

I check the flat profile table and see that the most time consuming regions
are func1 (taking up 62.58% of the runtime) and rand2 (taking 21.46%). 

I then go to the func.c file to modify func1. For the first for loop, I use a
- #pragma omp parallel for
OpenMP directive to just parallelize the loop. The second loop is a nested
loop and so that means that the variables inside the inner loop are
uninitialized at the beginning and end of the outer loop. With that, I used
the directive
- #pragma omp parallel for private(j, index_X, index_Y) 
to make those inner variables private.
I did used the same first directive for the initial for loops in func2 and 
func3.

 then clear the executables / output files and compile with omp again
- make clean
- make omp
- ./omp
and I get the results

FUNC TIME : 0.085188
TOTAL TIME : 2.006394

Dividing the original FUNC TIME by this one, I get a 5.51x speedup.
